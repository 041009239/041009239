I successfully completed the first two levels of my program "Computer Engineering Technology - Computing Science" and was named in the Dean’s Honours List in both terms.
During my studies, I enhanced my software development skills.
I have strong knowledge in Object-Oriented Design, coding in Java, C, HTML, CSS, Java Script and writing script for testing.
In addition, through the Database course, I developed the skill set to create and manipulate a well-designed database by using the SQL language and pgAdmin4.
I also built up a strong knowledge about Linux OS and Vim during the GNU/Linux course.
Moreover, I am learning Python on my own to expand my knowledge about programming. 
Furthermore, not only sharpen my technical knowledge, I also focus in enhancing my soft skills. 
By tackling diverse programing challenges within my courses and during my self-education, I excelled in analytical thinking and established a variety of analytical techniques to approach and solve problems. 
I often effectively maintain leadership in a group environment by understanding, motivating and respecting team members.
To accomplish the team’s objectives, I strategically utilize the strength and weakness of each member to encourage strategic thinking, innovation and action.
